## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder: Jae Yoon 
##### Goals:  
1. To get where they need to go with consideration for their handicap.
2. Find out how accessible the location they wanted to visit was.
3. Route planner that takes into account their specific handicap.
##### Concerns:
1. Accuracy of the accessibility information.
2. State of the amenities.

## Product Vision Statement

A crowdsourced accessibility focused navigation app where users can tailor routes to accomodate for their specific needs and collectively update a location's accessibility information.

## User Requirements

### As a user, I want to filter for restaurants that are wheelchair accessible so I can go out with my friends.
Estimation of effort: L  
Acceptance criteria:
1. User's accessibility needs are available to be selected.
2. User's accessibility profile is saved.
3. User's accessibility profile is private.
4. All restaurants that are wheelchair accessible are displayed.


### As a user, I want to plot a route for the visually impaired so I can more easily make my way to my destination.
Estimation of effort: M  
Acceptance criteria:
1. User's starting point is captured and saved.
2. User's destination is captured and saved.
3. A route using public transportation with amenities for the visually impaired is displayed.
4. If a complete route cannot be made, sections without amenities are indicated.


### As a user, I want to update a location's accessibility information so I can contribute to the app (this one needs better wording)
Estimation of effort: L  
Acceptance criteria:
1. An "update location amenities" button is visible.
2. A menu pops up when the button is pressed.
3. Users can select and deselect amenities.
4. Information is saved to the server.
5. If enough changes are indicated by users, the location's information is updated for all users of the app (with a confidence score).
